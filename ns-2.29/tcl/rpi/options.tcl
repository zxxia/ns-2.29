# This is an automatically generated file that specifies the paths
# to the applications used by the RPI graph package.  It is created by 
# /tank/zxxia/ns-allinone-2.29/ns-2.29/tcl/rpi/configure.tcl
#
# If you install an application used by NS then rerun configure to 
# set up the appropriate path.
#
# When configure.tcl was run it copied any prior version of options.tcl
# to a backup with the same name except ".bakXX" was appended.  Here 
# XX is replaced with a unique integer starting from 1.  Larger numbers 
# denote more recent versions of options.tcl.  If you no longer need
# a backup of the options.tcl file then you may delete it.
