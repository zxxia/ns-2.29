Frequently Asked Questions

----------------------------------------------------------
What versions of ns does the graph package currently support?

It has been tested with
  ns-2.1b9a, ns-2.26, ns-2.28, ns-2.31

----------------------------------------------------------
What platforms does the Graph package work on?

The graph package has only been tested in Sun Solaris and
RedHat Linux 6.2, 7.1, 8.0, and Ubuntu 6.06.1. The Graph package expects
the existence of certain utilities that are usually 
only included with UNIX (e.g., xgraph, gnuplot, latex, xdvi,
ghostview).  I have made no attempt to get the graph package
to work with Microsoft Windows.  

----------------------------------------------------------
Why does my simulation run so slowly when I generate graphs?

The Graph objects generate trace files. Outputting to these
trace files slows down a simulation.  You can often
speed up a simulation by telling a graph class to 
output average or sampled values every time interval rather than 
outputting instantaneous values (e.g., see Graph/QLenVersusTime in graph.tcl).  
Here the time interval is configureable allowing you to choose the 
appopriate trade-off between simulation run-times and the granularity of 
information you want displayed in your graphs.

----------------------------------------------------------
Why is my hard drive full?

If you have been running a large number of simulations with graphs
or nam trace files then you may have many large files in /tmp/expXX
directories where XX is replaced with a nonnegative integer.

The Graph baseclass comes with a "clean" instproc that tells the
graph's plot device to delete intermediate files.  All of the Graph
classes in the RPI graph.tcl file extend this instproc to 
remove their own intermediate files.  However, "clean" is not called 
automatically and many people neglect to call "clean" to remove a graph's 
intermediate files.  Furthermore, when people subclass Graph they often 
do not spend the time to extend "clean" to remove the subclass's 
intermediate files.

To solve this problem the user should occassionally delete all of the 
old /tmp/expXX directories.  In fact when I run simulations, I prefer
periodically deleting /tmp/expXX rather than calling clean.

----------------------------------------------------------
Why is installation so complicated?

The installation script is only partially automated.  I intend to improve 
the installation procedure in later releases.   Or perhaps I will
release a version of ns-2 with ns2graph bundled.

----------------------------------------------------------
Why can't I display using the xgraph, gnuplot, ... plot device?

There are several possible reasons.  Consider the following:
 1. Have you installed the corresponding program launched by
    the xgraph, gnuplot, etc. plot device? 
   xgraph, gnuplot, acroread, ghostview, xdvi, latex, etc. are not 
   included as part of the graph package.  They must be installed
   separately.  Often they are included as part of your UNIX distribution.

 2. Is xgraph, gnuplot, ... in your path?

   If these applications are not in your PATH then the installation
   script will query you for the path to the application executable.
   If you upgrade your UNIX installation, this may invalidate that paths
   to some of your application.  If an application suddenly is no longer
   available to NS then do the following:
     > cd $NS/tcl/rpi
     > ns configure.tcl
   

 3. Do you have an old version of gnuplot?

   gnuplot is used as intermediate plot device for many of 
   the other plot device's (e.g., postscript, xdvi, latex, ghostview, 
   acroread).  However, if you have gnuplot version 3.5 then you should
   use gnuplot35.  If you have an even earlier version of gnuplot
   then the graph package is unlikely to work with your version of gnuplot.

   Unfortunately it is not immediately obvious how to force the
   plot devices that use gnuplot as an intermediate step to switch over
   to version 3.5 compatibility.  I solved this problem by introducing
   the concept of "low level plotters."  Each graph that does not
   directly interface with a graph generating application excepts a
   "low_level_plotter" argument to its init instproc.  This 
   "low_level_plotter" object is nothing more than another plot device
   that generates output for the current plot device.  For example,

    set low_level_plotter [new gnuplot35]
    Graph set plot_device_ [new postscript $low_level_plotter]

   tells postscript to use the gnuplot 3.5 plot device to generate
   the graph rather than the default gnuplot plot device.

   The problem gets a little more complicated when more than two 
   plot device objects are used in the construction of output.
   Take for example the acroread object.  An acroread plot device object
   directly calls pdflatex on a latex file.  However, to first 
   generate the latex file, the acroread plot device object calls
   the latex plot device as a low_level_plotter.  The latex plot
   device in turn calls pdf as a low_level_plotter to generate
   graphs that are referenced by the latex.  The pdf plot device
   then calls gnuplot as a low level plotter.  The gnuplot plot 
   device then calls the gnuplot application directly.  Thus forcing 
   acroread to use gnuplot35 requires the following:
    set lowest_level_plotter [new gnuplot35]
    set pdf_plotter [new pdf $lowest_level_plotter]
    set latex_plotter [new latex $pdf]
    Graph set plot_device_ [new acroread $latex_plotter]
      
   Currently I assume that the set of plot devices used to generate
   output is just a list (as opposed to a directed tree or directed graph). 
   So far this has been sufficiently powerful to handle my needs. 

 4. Did your simulation generate any plot data?
   (see "Why do I get an `empty x range' error?")

If your problem does not fit any of the above four causes then you may have
found a bug in the Graph implementation (see "Who do I contact if I find
a bug?").

----------------------------------------------------------
Why do I get an "empty x range" error?

Do you see an error like the following?
  ns: finish: Warning: empty x range [0:0], adjusting to [0:1]
  Warning: empty y range [0:0], adjusting to [0:1]
      while executing
  "exec gnuplot "$command_filename_.gnuplot" "
  ...

gnuplot generates the above error (actually warning) message 
usually when the simulation script is misconfigured.  It 
occurs when a graph does not see any plot data.  Common reasons
are failing to correctly add sources to the topology,
running a simulation too short, or placing a graph on a link that
does not see any traffic.

Whom do I contact if I find a bug?

First go to the help forum at 

  http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ns2graph

Search the help forum.  If that doesn't help then go back to the URL above, 
scroll half-way down the page, click on "Bugs."
If you don't find your bug then report one.

This code was initially developed and has been traditionally 
maintained by Dr. David Harrison while he was at RPI, then at 
Berkeley.  He now manages development via sourceforge.
